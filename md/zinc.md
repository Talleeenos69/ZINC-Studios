# ZINC Programming Language
### Zero-cost INtegrated C++

ZINC is a programming language developed in C++ and C, designed to deliver equivalent, if not enhanced, functionality compared to these languages. The primary goals of ZINC include improved code comprehension and accelerated development speed.

ZINC is tailored for Linux/UNIX systems, with a planned port for Windows.

Compatibility with existing C or C++ libraries is a key feature of ZINC. However, programming with these libraries in ZINC is constrained to using their native syntax.
